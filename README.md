To-Do List Web Application with Flask

Objective: Developed a web application using the Flask framework to manage a to-do list with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Features:

Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
Remove Task: Tasks can be removed from the list individually.
Edit Task: Allows users to edit existing tasks directly from the web interface.
Responsive Design: Integrated Bootstrap framework for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
Technologies Used: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS (via Bootstrap).

Implementation:

Flask Routes: Defined routes for handling different operations such as adding, removing, and editing tasks.
Database: Used an in-memory list to store task data during runtime.
HTML Templates: Utilized Jinja2 templating engine to render dynamic HTML content.
Outcome: Created a user-friendly web application for managing personal tasks, demonstrating proficiency in web development with Flask and front-end integration with Bootstrap.

Skills Demonstrated: Web development, Flask framework, CRUD operations, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap for front-end styling, responsive design principles.

Future Enhancements:

Integration with a database system for persistent storage.
User authentication and authorization for secure task management.
Additional features like task prioritization, due dates, and categories.
Conclusion: This project showcases the ability to build practical web applications using Flask, demonstrating proficiency in both backend and front-end development. It also reflects an understanding of user needs in developing functional and intuitive interfaces for managing tasks effectively.
